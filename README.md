# Props Plant Trade

## Description 
Want to increase your houseplant collection while saving money? Props is a web app for plant lovers to advertise and trade their propagated houseplants. A user can create an account, sign in, and post their newly propagated houseplants.  You can create a wishlist for each plant you would like to trade for in return.  Once a plant is posted, browse the plant marketplace where other users have listed their propagated plants.  If you find one you like, you can either favorite it for later or send a message to a user to trade!
